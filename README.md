# Data Visualization
Student performance data visualization is live [here](https://student-performance-data.herokuapp.com/)!

## Description
Basically I just want to make a simple data visualization to find out how the distribution of math, reading, and writing scores will be if we choose certain criteria from the available features.

## Dataset
I use dataset from [Kaggle - Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)

## Streamlit
I set it up with simple web interface using [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/).
